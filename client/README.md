A boilerplate for a Webpack bundled React project with Babel. This has been created as part of a blog post series. Part one can be seen [here](https://www.self-taught-and-fraught.com/development/webpack-react-babel-2020/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this boilerplate running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn or npm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/webpack-react-babel <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

> Please credit this boilerplate if you build something fantastic!

## Running the tests

Available scripts:

```bash
yarn test
yarn test:watch
yarn test:coverage
```
